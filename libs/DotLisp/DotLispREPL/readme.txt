DotLisp began with Silk (now Jscheme, http://jscheme.sourceforge.net) a 
Scheme for Java.  I ported that from Java to C#, and from the JVM to the 
CLR.  I moved away from Scheme compatibility and changed the design and 
implementation significantly.  After a re-write, there is no Silk-based 
code left.  Nevertheless, I remain educated and inspired by the work done 
on Silk/Jscheme and grateful for the authors' generous contribution in 
opening their source.  The original Silk license is included in the 
file silk.txt.
