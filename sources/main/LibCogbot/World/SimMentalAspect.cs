        =======================================
        5.  Bot Needs
        =======================================

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1  The Eight Bot Needs
        ---------------------------------------

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.1  Hunger
        ---------------------------------------
             The sims need to eat to survive.  The better the cook is and the better 
        the food equipment is, the more satisfaction they get from food.  If you are 
        a great cook and have good cooking equipment you won't have to eat so many 
        times in a day.  Who ever the best cook in your family is should cook as many 
        meals as possible.  I would suggest having a 2nd cook.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.2  Fun
        ---------------------------------------
             Just like humans your sims need to have fun.  Many objects including 
        televisions, radios, pool tables, computers, and many other objects make your 
        sims life fun.  More expensive objects like the big screen T.V. and the 
        §6,500 computer have extremely high fun ratings.  When your are building your 
        first home, buy a 27 inch T.V.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.3  Room
        ---------------------------------------
             The room rating is how well lighted and decorated a room is.  A few 
        windows to let light in, are needed for the daytime.  At night a few lights 
        are also needed.  Rooms that are decorated also help increase the room 
        rating.  Furniture, pictures, and other objects help to increase the room 
        rating.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.4  Social
        ---------------------------------------
             Social comes from how much you talk to other sims.  Look below under 7.0 
        to learn more about friends.  A good place to gain social is eating, watching 
        T.V., being in the spa, and other objects where you can accomplish more then 
        one thing at a time.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.5  Energy
        ---------------------------------------
             Bots need to be awake to do things so they need to have lots of energy.  
        There are only two ways to increase energy, sleeping and drinking 
        coffee/espresso.  When buying a bed try to buy the most expensive one you can 
        because your sim wont have to spend so many hours sleeping.  Espresso doesn't 
        really help your energy much and coffee helps increase your energy less then 
        espresso.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.6  Hygiene
        ---------------------------------------
             Your sims need to smell good at work and home.  Take a shower or wash 
        your hands to increase you hygiene.  One shower a day should be enough.  If 
        you use the toilet wash your hands afterwards, instead of before hand.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.7  Bladder
        ---------------------------------------
             You need to use the bathroom every so often.  When this bar goes red it 
        means you need to go immediately.  Use the toilet to empty your bladder, 
        obviously. 

        ---------------------------------------
        5.1.8  Comfort
        ---------------------------------------
             Your sims need to be comfortable.  You can gain comfort by sitting in a 
        chair or sleeping in bed.  You can also gain comfort in the bath tub.

        ---------------------------------------
        5.2 Health
        ---------------------------------------
             Your sims can become sick.  If you have the guinea pig and don't clean 
        the cage or feed it often enough you could become sick.  If you become sick 
        sell the Guinea Pig Cage immediately.  Once you have sold the Guinea Pig, 
        have the sick sim stay in bed and get lots of sleep.  Also make sure the 
        needs are all green.  Your sim should also get lots of coffee / espresso and 
        stay away from the other sims.  It is ok if your sim misses a day of work.
