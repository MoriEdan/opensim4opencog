
Making SWI-Prolog live happy:

Create environment variables,

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=C:\development\opensim4opencog\bin
 SWI_HOME_DIR=C:\development\opensim4opencog

Add C:\development\opensim4opencog\bin to PATH

Install the 64bit or 32bit version SWI-Prolog to "c:\development\opensim4opencog" (but not "c:\development\opensim4opencog\pl")
File extension ".pl" (which is the default)

(This is so Cogbot/IKVM/SWI-Prolog all share the same "Bin" directories)
If you have another program that uses SWI-Prolog you might have to update how that program knows where it is.  Hopefully this will not be too difficult



Updating from SVN:

Make sure you are exited out Visual Studio unless you are prepared to say "yes" to 55 modal dialog boxes.  
Use tortuous SVN to right on "C:\development\opensim4opencog". 

After updating from SVN, it is important to run runprebuild.bat from inside the C:\development\opensim4opencog directory.  
This will regenerate the *.csproj files that are referenced from Cogbot_VS9.sln (but not the *.sln (Solution file)) 




Open the Solution file from inside Visual Studio 2008:

I do with cmdline: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" Cogbot_VS9.sln


When exiting from the running robot, use ?- halt.  from prolog.. When it gets the first breakpoint hit the square "stop" debugging.
